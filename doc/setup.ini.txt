setup.ini documentation

Note that setup.ini is automatically generated for the Cygwin site. This section is intended as a reference for writing software
that interoperates with the setup.ini package listing, or who are using a fork of setup elsewhere and want to know what they can
achieve with it. It is not aimed at setup end users or Cygwin package maintainers - although you may find it of interest.

setup reads a (possibly compressed) file called setup.ini that resides on all Cygwin mirrors. The format is quite flexible - it's
grown over time. The content of the file drives setup's behaviour. It lists the packages available from a given mirror site (the
one it is downloaded from), and what source files each package has, available versions, dependencies and the like.

A setup.ini file consists of optional header lines, followed by a sequence of package sections.

Lines that begin with the # character are ignored by setup, and can be used to add commentary to the file.

For forward compatibility, unrecognized lines should be ignored.

Headers

Header lines can only appear at the beginning of setup.ini files, before the first package section.

setup-timestamp: number

The time (in Unix epoch seconds) that the setup.ini file was created. Its purpose is to warn the user when the timestamp is less
than the last setup.ini used; i.e. it prevents accidental regression.

setup-version: version

The current version of setup when this setup.ini was generated. Setup will warn if the version of setup is less than this
version.

setup-minimum-version: version

The minimum version of setup needed to correctly parse and process this setup.ini. Setup won't proceed if it's version is less
than this.

release: text

A label for the package set. The label cygwin is reserved for use by cygwin.com

arch: x86|x86_64

The processor architecture this package set is built for.

Package section

@ package

Package: package

Lines beginning with the "at" symbol or "Package:" indicate the start of a package section. Each package section consists of a
name, descriptive texts, package categories, and one or more package version descriptions.

sdesc: "some text"

This is the "short description" of the package. This text, if available, accompanies the package name in package listings.

ldesc: "some text"

This is the "long description" of the package. This text, if available, is used as a supplemental description of the package.

category: name1[ name2...]

Section: name1[ name2...]

The category or Section line indicates the categories that this package belongs to. One package can belong to multiple
categories. Multiple categories are separated by spaces. See the description of categories in .hint files for more information on
categories.

message: id "some text"

Optional. This is text that will be displayed by setup when the package is installed.

requires: package[ package...]

Indicates a list of packages that this package needs at runtime in order to function correctly. Multiple packages should be
separated by a space.

replace-versions:version[ version...]

Optional. This is a list of withdrawn versions, which, if installed, should be replaced with the curr: version, even if it is
lower.

Version description

[curr]
[test]
[prev]
[<label>]

These indicate the start of a version description within a package section. Note that [curr] is the default, and may be omitted
if that version happens to be specified before the others.

"curr" indicates the current stable (preferred) version, and "test" indicates a test version. "<label>" carries no meaning except
to be a unique label for a version.

For historical reasons, "prev" is used for versions preceding the "curr" version.

For historical reasons, when multiple "prev" or "test" version descriptions exist, the last one appearing is the preferred (or
highest, if no preference exists).

version: version

Indicates the version of the package.

install: filename size-in-bytes hash

Indicates the archive file to install for that version, and its size in bytes, and a checksum. The file name must include the
path (relative to the base directory), and the file size must match the actual file size (setup uses this to verify it got the
whole file). The hash is a SHA512 hash encoded as 128 hex characters, or 86 base64 characters, or an MD5 hash encoded as 32 hex
characters. If it does not match the locally calculated hash, the package is considered corrupt and won't be installed by setup.
Hex characters are 0-9a-f (case matters).

source: filename size-in-bytes hash

Like install:, for the corresponding archive file to install the source.

Source: package [(version-identifier)]

Indicates the source-package containing the source for the current package version. i.e. for package foo-dev, one might have
"Source: foo-src" to indicate that the source package for foo-dev is foo-src. This entry should not be used in conjunction with
the "source:" entry.

depends2: version-relations

This is a more sophisticated version of requires:, allowing the specification of version relationships. depends: is a synonym for
depends2:.

obsoletes: version-relations

Indicates packages this package obsoletes.

Note: The following directives are not fully implemented yet.

Build-Depends: version-relations

Indicates the binary packages required to build the source package.

Syntax of relationship fields

Depends:, Obsoletes:, Build-Depends: all have a common syntax. They are a list of package names separated by commas. They may
restrict their applicability to particular versions of each named package. This is done in parentheses after each package name.
The parentheses should contain a relation, one of =,<=,>=,<,> followed by a version-identifier.

version-relations is version-relation [, version-relation ...]

version-relation is package [(= | <= | >= | < | > version-identifier)]
