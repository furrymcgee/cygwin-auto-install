Cygwin SSHD HowTo
How to run the OpenSSH SSHD server on Windows using Cygwin

Install the following Cygwin packages (rerun setup if necessary -- you can add
packages after you have already installed Cygwin).

    Admin --> cygrunsrv
    Net --> openssh

Open a new bash shell window and run the SSH configure stuff.

    ssh-host-config -y

This step will create necessary configuration files, a priviledge separation
user and necessary directories.

When prompted with "CYGWIN=" type for following:

    tty ntsec

Now you are ready to start the service.

    cygrunsrv -S sshd

Finished

Bugs

Sometimes you get a sshd/cygrunsrv service error after trying to run the
service.

    cygrunsrv: Error starting a service:
    QueryServiceStatus: Win32 error 1062:
    The service has not been started.

There can be a couple of causes for this. The following may fix the problem
(this is not an option on XP Home).

Solution 1.

You may have an old or corrupt installation of Cygwin. Try reinstalling. The
following may also help:

cygrunsrv -R sshd
REBOOT (or use the Task Manager to kill all instances of sshd that may be
running in the background)
run "ssh-host-config -y" again.
This seemed to help on a few systems I worked on.

Solution 2.

Open an explorer window and use the "Properties | Security" dialog and
explicitly add "Full Control" for the SYSTEM user to the following directories:

    C:\Cygwin
    C:\Cygwin\var
    C:\Cygwin\var\log

Hope that helps!
